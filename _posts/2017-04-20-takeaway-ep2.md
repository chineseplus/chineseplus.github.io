***Words & Expressions***

**【您】** **n** **í** **n** **;** **you (in a respectful way)**

**【大】** **da; big, large**

**【小】** **xiao; little, small**

**【姓】** **x** **ì** **ng** **;** **Family Name, Surname**

你姓什么?nǐ xìng shénme?

His family name is Zhang.

我不姓刘,我姓李。Wo bu xing liu, wo xing li

My family name is not Liu, it's Li.

**【叫】** **jiào** **;** **to be called**

This is the basic verb for stating one's name. Although you could translate "my name is..." literally into Chinese, it's more common to use this verb. The pattern is:

Person 叫 (jiào) Name ("Person is called Name" or "Person's name is Name)

Or:

Person1 叫 (jiào) Person2 Name ("Person1 calls Person2 Name")

你叫什么名字?nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?

What's your name?

我叫张杰。wǒ jiào Zhāng Jié。

叫我张杰。Jiào wǒ Zhāng Jié

Call me Zhang Jie.

**【呢** ******】** **ne; question particle**

呢 (ne) is used at the end of non-yes-no question sentences. You can think of as meaning, "and what about...?" even though that might not always be the most appropriate English translation.

The most common pattern you'll see is: Noun +呢 (ne)?

我很好。你呢?wǒ hěn hǎo。nǐ ne?

I'm very good. You?

我姓王。你呢?wǒ xìng Wáng。nǐ ne?

My surname is Wang. How about you?

**【什么】** **shen me: what**
