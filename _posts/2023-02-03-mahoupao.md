**Definition & Usage**

马后炮 was originally a Chess term, literally, it means to place the cannon(knight) behind the horse(knight) in chess games. It refers to the check move,  putting the other player's king under direct attack. Gradually, 马后炮 is used to indicate **a belated action or give advice in hindsight**. When it refers to an action, the verb that goes with it is "放", and the collocation is **放马后炮**. When it is used to describe a person, it refers to a person who criticizes or suggests alternative courses of action from a position of hindsight after the event in question. In colloquial Chinese, it is also called "**事后诸葛亮**（shìhòu zhūgéliàng, be wise after the event)".Both 马后炮 and 事后诸葛亮 can be translated into "Monday-morning quarterback" or "second guesser".
