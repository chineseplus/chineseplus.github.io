**Definition & Usage**

护短 literally means to protect one's shortcomings. This verb actually means "to defend sb (a relative, friend, or oneself) despite knowing that that person is in the wrong.

Some may translate 护短 into "cover up one's mistakes", which doesn't exactly point out the right situation to use it. Most times, 护短 refers to protecting your own member(s) (in your family or your organization) who is faulty in a dispute or fight. Let's say your kid quarreled with another kid of your neighbors'. You will speak for your own kid even though it is your kid's fault. Or, you are protecting your subordinate, your man in your team, that kind of behavior is called "护短".

It conveys something like, "Don't judge me, my friends or my family; Never blame me or criticize me; If I make a mistake, you must ignore it. Then you are my friend."
