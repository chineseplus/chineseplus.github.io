Cam: Yajie, the best thing about China definitely has to be the food.  There are so many different cuisines, I feel like I have been eating non-stop since I got here.

YJ:  Yes, China is famous for its scrumptious food, and we are going to start a two-week long look at different foods and how to speak in a restaurant on our Chinese Studio.

Cam: Ah, I am getting hungry at the thought. We can’t start this soon enough!

*****************

Cam: So Yajie, when I walk into a restaurant, they often say something to me to welcome me. Something like ......What is that? 

YJ: Usually it’s欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2), Welcome.

Cam: 欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2). 

YJ: 欢迎, h-u-a-n, y-i-n-g, the first tone, and the second tone. 

Cam: 欢迎. Right?

YJ: Yes. And 光临 shows the respect for the consumers. 光临, g-u-a—n-g, l-i-n.

Cam: 光临 (guang1lin2) also the first tone, and the second tone.. 

YJ:　欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2), Welcome.

Cam: 欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2).

YJ: You may also hear欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2) when entering a department store and so on. 

Cam: Ok, I understand this now. 欢迎光临(huan1ying2 guang1lin2) , Welcome.

Conversation1:

YJ: After you enter the restaurant, a waiter or waitress will lead you to a table. Generally speaking, if there are more than four people, you will be taken to a large table. 

Cam: Ok. I see. Then he or say will say请坐(qing3 zuo4)。Please be seated. Right? 

YJ: Yes. 请(qing3) means please. And 坐(zuo4) means to sit down. , the fourth tone. 

Cam: 坐 (zuo4), to sit down. And “Please be seated” then 请坐(qing3 zuo4).

Conversation2:

YJ: Then you will be asked to order dishes. You may hear this: 您吃点儿什么(nin2 chi1 dianr3 shenme2)？What would you like to eat? 

Cam: 您吃点儿什么(nin2 chi1 dianr3 shenme2)？

YJ: 您 (nin2)is the polite form of 你(ni3). 

Cam: 您 (nin2).

YJ: And 吃, c-h-i, the first tone, means to eat.

Cam: 吃(chi1). 

YJ: 吃点儿(chi1 dianr3), to eat a little bit. Here点儿( dianr3) is short for 一点儿 ( yì dianr3)，which means a little bit. 吃点儿(chi1 dianr3).

Cam: 吃点儿(chi1 dianr3).But that means I just have to eat just a little bit?

YJ: Well here's the thing that I’d like to point out. Although here the waiter or waitress says 吃点儿 (chi1 dianr3), to eat a little bit, actually, it doesn’t mean you could order only a little bit. Instead you can order anything that you want. 

Cam: OK. But sometimes I hear waitress say “您吃什么？” There is no 点儿 “dianr3”.

YJ: It’s all right to say您吃什么？But this sounds too direct and a little bit imprudent. So usually waitresses would say您吃点儿什么(nin2 chi1 dianr3 shenme2)？

Cam: 您吃点儿什么(nin2 chi1 dianr3 shenme2)？

YJ: Next comes to 喝(he1) which means to drink. H-e, the first tone. 

Cam: 喝(he). Now I know how they say “What would you like to drink?”. It would be 您喝点儿什么(nin2 he1 dianr3 shenme2)？

YJ: Exactly. 您喝点儿什么(nin2 he1 dianr3 shenme2)？What would you like to drink?
