**Definition & Usage**

**心眼儿 basically means one's thoughts, mind, and vision.**  Actually, 心眼儿 can refer to a lot of meanings depending on different collocations. Today we are talking about the adjective collocation "小心眼儿".

**小心眼儿 generally refers to narrow-mindedness, short-sightedness, suspicious mentality, small ideas on trivial matters, etc.**  It's derogatory. Usually, we can describe a man with traits of intolerance, suspicion, jealousy, and stinginess as 小心眼儿. In colloquial, don't forget the suffix 儿. 

Since 小心眼儿 has many meanings in different contexts, we can get a clearer idea about it by looking into what a "不小心眼儿的人" looks like. A man who is not "小心眼儿" may be generous, big heart, open-minded and easy-going. Now, let's learn this adjective in example sentences.
