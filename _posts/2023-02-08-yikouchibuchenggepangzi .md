**Definition & Usage**

The idiom "一口吃不成个胖子" literally means one bite won't make you a fat man, actually, **it means nothing can be accomplished in one single effort, people have to do things step by step**. Chinese people also say  **"饭要一口一口地吃"** , the literal meaning is "you should eat your meal in bites one by one, it tells people that one should do his job or achieve his goal step by step, don't push it. 

There is an English idiom "biting off more than you can chew". The situation of using this idiom is the same as that of the saying "一口吃不成个胖子".

**Grammar points "成" and "不成"** 

**"成" in the phrase "吃不成" serves as a result complement*结果补语 (jiéguǒ bǔyǔ),* you can translate it into "into" or "become".** 

In the phrase "吃成一个胖子", 成 indicates the result of the action "eating too much", that is someone eats too much that he becomes a fat man. To negate the result complement "成", we use "不成"  other than "没成". Remember that 不 negates verbs about the present or future, whereas 没有 is used for things in the past. Meanwhile, 没成 in Chinese means "doesn't work" or "doesn't succeed".吃不成个胖子 means to eat but can't become a fat man.
