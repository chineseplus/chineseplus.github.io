**If you are a newbie in Chinese, “怎么说 (how to say…)” is a very useful phrase that you should learn. Also, “这”“这个”“那”“那个” are very common pet phrases in Chinese language. So when Chinese people hesitated and say “这”and “这个”, what do they really mean? What’s the difference between “这”and “那”?**

**Part I：Chinese 101**

***Dialogue***

A：请问，这个怎么说？

qǐng wèn ，zhè gè zěn me shuō ？

B：这是一本书。

zhè shì yī běn shū。

This is a book.

A：那是什么？

B：那是一个苹果。

nà shì yī gè píng guǒ。

That’s an apple.

***Words and Expressions***

**【这】zhè;this**

这是：This is

**【那】nà; that**

**【怎么】zěn me:by what means**

Grammar: The word "how" can mean a lot of things, and so can its Chinese counterpart. In this case, it means "by what means" or "in what fashion." It precedes verbs.

How will you spend the New Year?

How can I contact you?

熟能生巧：Practice Makes Perfect

**熟能生巧**

**shú néng shēng qiǎo**

**Practice makes perfect**

1000 years ago during the Northern Song Dynasty, an old oil peddler masterfully poured oil into a gourd and told everybody that practice makes perfect.  


Literal meaning: Practice makes perfect

E.g

孰能生巧，你不必担心自己的中文口语，只要勤加练习就好了。

shú néng shēng qiǎo，nǐ bú bì dān xīn zì jǐ de zhōng wén kǒu yǔ，zhī yào qín jiā liàn xí jiù hǎo le。

Practice makes perfect, so you don't need to worry about your spoken Chinese proficiency. All you need to do is to practice more.
